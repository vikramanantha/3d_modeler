3D Model her? I hardly know her!

## Background

I have a lot of Aerial Photos. It would be cool to make 3D models with the photos that I have, especially since most of the aerial shoots I have would do this.

## The Project

Use VGGT to process the photos that I have, and then generate the model. Display the Ply on the website.
